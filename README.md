# pinch_zoom

A widget based on Flutter's new Interactive Viewer that makes picture pinch zoom, and return to its initial size and position when released.

This package offers Instagram based pinch zooming that feels more responsive than other similar packages.

This package is based on the recent Interactive Viewer that Flutter introduced since version 1.20.

The package is designed for zooming in on images; however, it can also be used to zoom in on a video.

    child: Image.network('https://placekitten.com/640/360'),
    resetDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 100),
    maxScale: 2.5,
    onZoomStart: (){print('Start zooming');},
    onZoomEnd: (){print('Stop zooming');},
),
```
